**call to action:** what we need most to help advance Ricky Harrington is social media engagement, donations, and volunteers. Please consider helping move the narrative that Ricky Dale Harrington (RDH) is a viable, last-minute, possible come-from-behind challenge for Cotton.

##talking points for poll conducted october 7-9

- **Harrington positioned to *outperform* Democrat's last go round:** RDH polling 38/49 with 13 undecided; Mark Pryor [lost 39/57](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_Senate_election_in_Arkansas) to Tom Cotton in 2014.

- **Relatively unknown RDH already polling 38% is incredible:** *Background: Many outlets [claiming](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/06/23/ar_as_tom_cotton_courts_controversy_he_runs_unopposed_515168.html) this is an uncontested race, since AR State GOP chicanery led to the [Democrat dropping out](https://apnews.com/article/75ea6fa6c0fd44a89674f5274ea9bf3c) and leaving Cotton with only Independent Whitfield and Libertarian RDH challengers. Further GOP chicanery (judical delay) led to Indep. Whitfield losing his ballot access. He ran a VERY strong campaign nonetheless, only [conceding just over a week ago.](https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/politics/dan-whitfield-suspends-us-senate-race-after-not-getting-on-the-ballot/527-dc966fde-0d1a-4b1b-90b3-ad279b60fcc8)* Enter RDH versus Cotton. The state barely knows who he is yet he is polling as good as heavily financed Pryor in previous election.

- **Even a close RDH loss is a huge blow to Tom Cotton:** Unknown 3rd party guy came within 6 points of beating you in your home state? Maybe you shouldn't be the Republican nominee for president in 2024. (Yes, he is DEFINITELY [gunning for it](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/think-donald-trump-is-bad-president-tom-cotton-would-be-even-more-terrifying))

- **Cotton under 50%:** that says it all. There's a plus minus four point margin of error, so its conceivable that he's even a point or two lower. This is a head to head race, there's not even a write-in candidate much less a place on the ballot to write one

- **High number of undecideds:** Arkansas knows who Tom Cotton is, they don't yet know who RDH is. The undecideds are his to win in the final stretch.

- **Ricky Harrington is a great candidate:** He is a pragmatist with broad appeal. He champions social issues like criminal justice reform without denigrating LEO. He is passionate about the cause of Liberty. He is a man of faith, a requirement to win in Arkansas. He is married with 3 kids, his wife is in the Navy. He's not a warm body, he is the real deal.

- **Win would be historic:** First African-American Senator from Arkansas, first Libertarian or Green in the US Senate. If he sat in a split Senate he would be in a position to be a swing senator and could [force bipartisanship](https://talkbusiness.net/2020/09/libertarian-senate-candidate-ricky-harrington-calls-for-end-to-hyper-partisanship/
